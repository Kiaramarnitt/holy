The Hydrogen Ontology (HOLY) is a domain ontology for describing the complex structure of hydrogen-based markets.. Its target audience includes industrial, governmental, and research institutions that require continuous monitoring of market developments to evaluate and adjust their strategies. As a tool for automatically analyzing international market activity in the hydrogen environment, HOLY provides a structured and adaptable market model for the business community in the hydrogen sector. Hence, it provides a foundation for retrieval, storage, and delivery of market insights. 


HOLY was developed using [OWL 2 Web Ontology Language](http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/) in [Proteg√©](https://protege.stanford.edu/). The overall structure consists of over 100 classes storing information about organizations, projects, products, applications, markets, and indicators and conceptualizes market relationships of production, cooperation, geographic placement, provision of goods or services, and indicators.

The ontology is  maintained by the [Future Engineering Research Group](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/einrichtungen-gesamt/fraunhofer-forschungsgruppen/future-engineering/), a cooperation in between the Technische Hochschule Georg-Simon-Ohm and the Fraunhofer IIS. Further information of the HOLY project can be found in the [HOLY Website](https://purl.org/holy), to contribute to HOLY  contact the [Future Engineering Group](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/einrichtungen-gesamt/fraunhofer-forschungsgruppen/future-engineering/).

## 1. Introduction

The Hydrogen Ontology (HOLY) is a domain ontology for the hydrogen market which aims to provide conceptual information of the current status and potential developments in the hydrogen market. Its target audience includes industrial, governmental, and research institutions that require continuous monitoring of market developments to evaluate and adjust their strategies. In its current version, which focuses on Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs), it is designed to classify information concerning the composition of PEMFCs, their use, manufacturers, geographic areas, indicators, and projects. Conceptualizing market requirements is done by providing extensions to other areas of interests such as the organization domain, geo-location, indicators, project schemas, and applications.

The ontology is intended to structure market-relevant domain information for the hydrogen market in an accessible format and provide a generic, reusable core for expansion in different areas along the hydrogen value chain or even the use of certain content patterns for other market domain ontologies.

HOLY defines its own classes and properties to describe the hydrogen market, but also uses classes and properties from already existing ontologies. All newly-defined concepts are located in the namespace of HOLY. The Hydrogen Ontology utilizes specific elements from select ontologies but does not import full ontologies. As it is intended to structure market-relevant domain information for the hydrogen market, only relevant concepts from existing ontologies are used.

Additional information regarding the HOLY project can be found on the [HOLY website](https://purl.org/holy). If you would like to contribute to HOLY, please contact the [Future Engineering Group](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/einrichtungen-gesamt/fraunhofer-forschungsgruppen/future-engineering/).

### Entity Naming Convention

For the labeling of entities belonging to the namespace HOLY, the following naming conventions from Open Biologican and Biomedical Ontology Foundry (OBO) [ [1](https://obofoundry.org/principles/fp-012-naming-conventions.html), [2](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-10-125/tables/1)] were used:

-   use `rdfs:label` for the primary label
-   include exactly one `rdfs:label` for every declared entity (e.g., class, property)
-   use spaces to separate words. Do not use CamelCase, do_not_use_underscores
-   avoid extra spaces between words, or at the beginning or end of the term label
-   spell out abbreviations. Abbreviations can be included as a separate property
-   make the primary labels to be as unambiguous as possible. Remember, your ontology may be used in a different context than that for which it was originally intended. Remember also of course that the label should be unambiguous without looking at parent terms
-   labels should be unique within an ontology
-   Prefer singular nominal form

In addition to the above-mentioned naming conventions, `skos:altLabel` was used to provide synonyms for entities and all words in primary labels were capitalized.

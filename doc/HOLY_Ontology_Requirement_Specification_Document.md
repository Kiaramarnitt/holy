|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1**  | **Purpose**                             |
|        | The purpose of this ontology is to represent the complex and dynamic structures of the hydrogen market.        |
| **2**  | **Scope**                               |
|        | **Hydrogen Market Structure:** The ontology focuses on market structures which are aligned with the Porters 5 Forces market model to analyze the competitiveness of an industry. General coverage concerning dynamic and complex structures involve the use of products/technologies, participants within the hydrogen industry and their role in providing applications and products. |
|        | **Market Development:** The current scope of HOLY is focused on the development of products along the hydrogen value chain and their use in applications. At this time, it focuses specifically on Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs). |
| **3**  | **Implementation Language (optional)**                                                                         |
|        | HOLY was developed using the OWL 2 Web Ontology Language.                                                      |
| **4**  | **Intended End-Users (optional)**                                                                              |
|        | Industrial Institutions, Governmental Institutions, Research Institutions                                      |
| **5**  | **Intended Uses**                       |
|        | Structural backbone for classifying market data from NLP Extraction methods. Knowledge base for strategic foresight purposes. Data source for data querying usable for user-friendly business intelligence tools (for specific use cases please see [Use Case:](./doc/Use_Case/) Atlant-H project)        |
| **6**  | **Ontology Requirements**               |
|        | **Non-Functional Requirements**         |
|        | Use of existing Ontologies. Reusability of the Ontology. Standardization and Semantic Interoperability. Online Availability. |
|        | **Functional Requirements: Lists or tables of (domain) requirements written as Competency Questions and sentences**                                     |
|        | See [HOLY_Use_Case_requirements](./doc/Use_Case/HOLY_Use_Case_requirements/) and [HOLY_Template_for_MODA_Documents](./doc/HOLY_Template_for_MODA_Documents/) |
| **7**  | **Pre-Glossary of Terms (optional)**                                                                           |

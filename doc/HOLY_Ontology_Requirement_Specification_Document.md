|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1**  | **Purpose**                             |
|        | The purpose of this ontology is to represent the complex and dynamic structures of the hydrogen market.        |
| **2**  | **Scope**                               |
|        | **Hydrogen Market Structure:** The ontology focuses on market structures aligned to the Porters 5 Forces market model to analyse competitiveness of an industry. General coverage concerning dynamic and complex structures involve the use of products / technologies, participants within the hydrogen industry and its role on providing applications and products.   **Market Development:** The current scope of HOLY is focused on the development of products alongside the hydrogen value chain and its use in applications. Hereby, it recently focuses specifically on Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cells. |

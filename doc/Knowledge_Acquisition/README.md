# Knowledge Acquisition / Curation Steps

Throughout the Ontology Engineering process of HOLY domain experts, ontology developers and users were all active contributors. Close engagement with users meant the introduction of requirements for NLP processes. 

The knowledge acquisition process involved extensive literature research by ontology developers to identify relevant sources on the hydrogen industry, followed by verification by experts from the Future Engineering Research Group of Fraunhoffer IIS and the Technische Hochschue Georg Simon Ohm. Concepts were derived from the literature and prioritized based on the ontology requirements. Synonyms were chosen with the assistance of the Information Extraction pipeline part of the Atlant-H.

## Requirements Gathering

Requirements are captured from stakeholders by identifying key areas of interest, eliciting competency questions and desirable features of the ontology. As such, this step included consulting with domain and technical experts.

* Domain expert interviews helped identify a general overview of the hydrogen market and select key areas of interest "Scope". Requirements have also been gathered from previous client questions interested in an analysis of the hydrogen market. 

* Interviews with technical expert (ontology user) in Atlanta-H project provided requirements for the NLP process.

## Literature Research based on requirements

**Market Insights (domain expert):** Theory complies with identifying the hydrogen value chain, components of fuel cells, research constructs, (potential) use cases and standards to differentiate market players. More practical acquisition was concerned in identifying players, their products, their location and their partners.

**Suitable Ontologies/Vocabularies:** Ontologies which contain ideas or components suitable for HOLY. 

**Information Extraction:** Focused on the acquisition of knowledge (semantic informaiton) necessary for information extraction methods for current and later adaptations for HOLY 

## Practical Literature review to populate the onotlogy
Additional research included the identification of definitions, synonymys and examples for enrichment of the ontology. A traceable reference to the source of each definition is available through the property `dct:references`.

# Use Case Specification of the Hydrogen Ontology

The following document introduces eight example use cases for the Hydrogen Ontology (HOLY). The use case specification is aligned with the standards of the Linked Open Terms Methodology.

## Name: Use Case 1 – Industry Players: Decision-Making

**Description:** It is challenging for businesses to keep track of a highly dynamic market with many possible disruptive technologies. Faced with this problem, a business organization uses the Hydrogen Ontology (HOLY) to structure their information and construct a knowledge graph. This enables them to obtain summarized structured information about changes in available use cases within their geographic market, substitute products, competitors or other occurrences which could be relevant to their business model.

The structured information in the knowledge graph, in combination with reusable queries, helps the company to save valuable resources for collecting and analyzing data by relying on highly valuable holistic data for decision-making.

**Actors:** Organizations

## Name: Use Case 2 – Governmental Institutions: Monitoring

**Description:** Monitoring the development of other nations in the evolving industry of hydrogen is important, but requires access to numerous sources and time to structure information accordingly. To enable holistic monitoring, a government institution uses the HOLY knowledge structure and preceding text-processing pipeline. Thanks to HOLY, the institution can access information about the development of projects, the number of organizations, and fields of applications in its nation and other nations. Thanks to the use of other vocabularies and ontologies and the alignment with classification standards, other knowledge graphs or databases can be integrated with HOLY, enabling institutions an even broader use.

**Actors:** Governmental institutions

## Name: Use Case 3 – Research Institutions: Facilitating Research Planning

**Description:** When starting a research project, it can be challenging to acquire a general overview of the current state of the domain or to find suitable partners for establishing research cooperations. This is especially true when dealing with a highly dynamic market such as the hydrogen market. A research institution uses HOLY as an advanced database structure to search for developments in the hydrogen market to streamline the process of identifying current key areas of interest. Thanks to the holistic structure, the institution can identify the current composition of the market according to existing participants, products, applications, projects, and indicators, even allocating them to geographic regions without the need to invest resources.

**Actors:** Research institutions (universities)

## Name: Use Case 4 - Technology Providers: Development Monitoring

**Description:** For the producer or manufacturer of a technology, monitoring the development of the technology they're providing is critical. In the hydrogen market, the amount of information and sources of information can provide great difficulty. Because of this, a technology provider uses HOLY to provide structure to the data, allowing for the filtering of data related to the development of their technology and relevant activity in the market. With this, the technology provider is able to monitor changes many aspects such as activity in specific geographic regions, keywords related to the technology, competitors' activity, and relevance of their technology in the market.

It is also important to monitor the development of technologies which could be used as substitutes to the technology produced. To accomplish this, the technology provider's research and development department builds upon the structure provided in HOLY and expands the ontology to include a more in-depth view of relevant substitute technologies. HOLY provides the technology provider with a foundational structure on which to expand to facilitate monitoring the development of substitute technologies.

**Actors:** Technology providers

## Name: Use Case 5 - Investors: Information Gathering, Monitoring

**Description:** When looking to invest in a new market, the amount of new information can be overwhelming. This is particularly relevant in highly dynamic markets which are subject to great amounts of change. To combat this, a potential investor uses HOLY to research potential investment opportunities in the hydrogen market. The structure that HOLY provides facilitates exploratory analysis and a comprehensive overview of the technologies and players in the market. The potential investor can therefore identify ideal investment opportunities according to their own criteria. 

After investing, the investor can continue to benefit from the use of HOLY to monitor changes in the hydrogen market which are related to or could impact their investment.

**Actors:** Investors

## Name: Use Case 6 - Product Users: Product Catalog and Comparison

**Description:** In the digital age more than ever before, users want to compare products to a great extent. However, this can be difficult when a market is large or continually evolving. The detailed structure of the PEMFC technology subclass in HOLY is used as a guide to extend the Hydrogen Ontology to include this level of detail among other products/technologies. This allows for the creation of a comprehensive product catalog for hydrogen technologies which can be used to compare products according to user-specified criteria. A product user then uses this product catalog to select the right product for their needs.

**Actors:** Product users

## Name: Use Case 7 - Educational Institutions: Education and Training

**Description:** Creating educational materials about hydrogen as either a technology or a market can be a daunting and time-consuming task. An educational institution uses HOLY as a structured information source which helps to filter relevant data and consolidate data from large varieties of information sources. HOLY allows for explorative analysis of hydrogen technologies and the hydrogen market. This facilitates the creation of educational materials and training programs which allow for students, professional individuals, research teams, and other interested parties to more easily expand their knowledge base on the subject.

**Actors:** Educational institutions

## Underlying Flow for all Use Cases

Flow: Alternatively, the actor can directly access the knowledge graph by using the resource documentation and SPARQL queries to filter for needed information within the knowledge graph. Information can be extracted too further process it, draw conclusions, and use it for action.

Additionally, as part of the [Atlant-H project](../Use_Case/), interactive dashboards have been constructed from a knowledge graph created using the Hydrogen Ontology. These dashboards can be accessed by the actor. Through filters in the user interface of the dashboard, the actor can retrieve information based on their requirements.

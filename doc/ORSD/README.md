| **1**  | **Purpose**                             |
|        | The purpose of this ontology is to represent the complex and dynamic structures of the hydrogen market.        |
| **2**  | **Scope**                               |
|        |  <ul> <li> **Hydrogen Market Structure:** The ontology focuses on market structures aligned with the Porters 5 Forces market model to analyze the competitiveness of an industry. General coverage concerning dynamic and complex structures involves the use of products/technologies, participants within the hydrogen industry and its role in providing applications and products. </li><li> **Hydrogen Sector Development:** The current scope of HOLY is focused on the development of products along the hydrogen value chain and their use in applications. Hereby, the current version focuses specifically on Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs). </li> <li> **Hydrogen Technological Knowledge** </li> </ul> |
| **3**  | **Implementation Language (optional)**                                                                         |

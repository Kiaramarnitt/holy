# Use Case Specification of the Hydrogen Ontology

The following document introduces three exemplary use cases for the Hydrogen Ontology (HOLY). The use case specification is aligned to the standards of the Linked Open Terms Methodology.

## Name: Use Case 1 – Industry Players: Decision-Making

**Description:** It is challenging for businesses to keep track of a highly dynamic market with many possible disruptive technologies. Faced with this problem, a business organization uses the knowledge graph of the Hydrogen Ontology (HOLY) to obtain summarized structured information about changes in available use cases within its geographic market, substitute products, competitors or other occurrences which could be of thread to their business model.

The structured information in the knowledge graph in combination with reusable queries helps the company to save valuable resources for collecting and analyzing data by relying on high valuable holistic data for decision-making.

**Actors**: Organizations

## Name: Use Case 2 – Governmental Institutions: Monitoring

**Description:** Monitoring the development of other nations in the evolving industry of hydrogen is important but requires access to numerous sources and time to structure information accordingly. To enable holistic monitoring, a government institution uses the HOLY knowledge structure and preceding text-processing-pipeline. Thanks to HOLY, the institution can access information about the development of projects, number of organizations, fields of applications in its and other nations. Thanks to the use of other vocabularies and ontologies and the alignment with classification standards, other knowledge graphs or databases can be integrated enabling institutions an even wider use.

**Actors**: Governmental institutions

## Name: Use Case 3 – Research Institutions: Facilitating Research Planning

**Description:** When starting a research project, it can be challenging to acquire a general overview of the current state of the art or to find suitable partners for establishing research cooperation’s. This is especially true when dealing with a highly dynamic market, such as hydrogen. A research institution uses HOLY as an advanced database to search for development in the hydrogen market to streamline the process to identify current key areas of interest. Thanks to the holistic structure, the institution can identify without the need to invest resources the current composition of the market according to existing participants, products, applications, projects, and indicators, even allocating them to geographic regions.

**Actors**: Research institutions (universities)

## Underlying Flow for all Use Cases

Flow: The actor accesses the dashboards connected to the Hydrogen Ontology. Through filters in the user interface of the dashboard, the actor can retrieve information based on their requirements. Information can be extracted in order to further process it, draw conclusions, and use it for action.

Alternatively, the actor can directly access the knowledge graph by using the resource documentation and SPARQL queries to filter for needed information within the knowledge graph. Information can be extracted in order to further process it, draw conclusions, and use it for action.

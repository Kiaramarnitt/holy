## Use Case 

# Atlant-H: AI-based analysis of text media about activities in the international hydrogen market

The Hydrogen Ontology is one of the ontological structures used in the Atlant-H project from the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Systems (IIS). 
The goal of this project is to develop a tool that, through the use of intuitive dashboards, allows for a dynamic, data-based overview of the hydrogen market with a focus on fuel cells. To achieve this, more than 10,000 international publications (e.g., contributions from publishing and scientific platforms, press releases, company news, etc.) need to be processed automatically each month. For this purpose, machine-learning methods for Natural Language Processing (NLP) as well as Semantic Web technologies are implemented and methods for extracting and modeling knowledge from text-based media sources are developed. 

Atlant-H offers an up-to-date market overview of developments in the fuel cell environment. To this end, it integrates ontological structures with an NLP-powered pipeline and delivers results through user-friendly Dashboards.

The NLP-based pipeline has as goal the extraction of domain-relevant information from unstructured data. The pipeline includes ontological components to identify relevant entities and relationships based on the ontological structure and semantic information encoded within the ontology. The lexical-semantic layer in HOLY helps classify the extracted entities. Additionally, the use of ontological axioms allows for the inference of new information. Hence, the semantic information in HOLY is used to automatically adjust the NLP task and organize the collected information. The results are then stored in a Knowledge Graph, which is the used to build user-friendly Dashboards to enable monitoring of the hydrogen market. 

A preliminary dashboard of the Atlant-H project is available on the link below. This Dashboard was built from a Knowledge Graph containing 526 924 triples.
